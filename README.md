# emerge
Emergent Behavior Modeling

Works on Windows, not tested on anything else.

To begin, open a command prompt and type 'python'. The result should say 'Python 3.x.x'. If not, code may not run. Look up installing Python 3.0.

Next, make sure pip is installed (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Next, run the following commands:

pip install pygame

pip install numpy

Should work.
